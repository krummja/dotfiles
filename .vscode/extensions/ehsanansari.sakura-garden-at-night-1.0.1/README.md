Sakura Garden At Night is a happy dark theme inspired by japanese sakura gardens. This dark theme is optimized for long hours of coding in low light. The theme uses warm colors in order to prevent retinal damage caused by blue light emitted from computer screens. SGAN is designed and developed specifically for Dart/Flutter but it's also compatible with other coding environments.

Enjoy,
Esan
